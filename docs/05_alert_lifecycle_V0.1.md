## **Alert Lifecycle Model (v0.1)**

## **Purpose**

This document defines the lifecycle of advisory alerts generated by the GxP Deviation Risk Sentinel. It specifies permitted alert states, state transitions, role responsibilities, and audit logging requirements. Alerts are advisory and do not represent confirmed deviations.

**Alert States**  
Alerts use a simple, controlled lifecycle:

* *NEW*: Alert has been generated and is awaiting review.  
* *ACKNOWLEDGED*: Alert has been seen and accepted for follow-up review.  
* *CLOSED*: Alert has been reviewed and closed with a resolution category.

***State Transition Rules***

Allowed transitions:

* NEW \-\> ACKNOWLEDGED  
* NEW \-\> CLOSED (permitted when resolution is immediate and documented)  
* ACKNOWLEDGED \-\> CLOSED

*Disallowed transitions:*

* CLOSED \-\> any state (no reopening in v0.1; reopening requires a new alert linked via reference)

.

**Roles & Responsibilities (Advisory)**  
This system supports visibility and acknowledgement flows but does not make quality decisions.

 *QA:*

*  Receives HIGH/CRITICAL alerts by default  
*  Can ACKNOWLEDGE and CLOSE alerts  
*  Provides closure category and minimal resolution notes (non-GMP)

 *Area Management:*

*  Receives alerts for operational awareness  
*  Can ACKNOWLEDGE alerts (optional; visibility-focused)  
*  May propose closure category but QA remains authoritative for HIGH/CRITICAL

 *DOC (Digital Operations Center)***:**

*  Receives alerts for monitoring and coordination  
*  Can ACKNOWLEDGE alerts for tracking  
*  Does not make quality decisions


**Closure Categories**  
Alert closure should use one of the following categories:

* *FALSE\_POSITIVE:* Rule triggered appropriately but does not indicate true risk upon review.  
* *ACTION\_TAKEN:* Action taken outside the Sentinel (e.g., corrected missing entry); Sentinel records advisory closure only.  
* *ESCALATED:* Escalated to an established quality process (e.g., deviation workflow) outside the Sentinel.  
* *DUPLICATE\_SUPPRESSED:* Closed because a higher-priority or identical alert already exists.  
* *INFORMATIONAL\_ONLY:* Closed after review as informational, no further action needed.

***Note:*** Closure notes must be short and must not include GMP values, batch narrative text, or attachments.

***Alert Fields***  
Each alert must include:

* *alert\_id*  
* *created\_at*  
* *status*  
* *severity*  
* *risk\_code*  
* *rule\_id \+ rule\_version*  
* *site \+ area \+ product\_id*  
* *template identifiers \+ step/section context*  
* *contributing event\_refs (event IDs only; metadata reference)*

*Optional:*

* batch\_token (pseudonymized)  
* operator\_token (pseudonymized)

*Audit Logging Requirements:*  
The Sentinel must maintain an append-only log of:

* Alert created (alert\_id, rule\_id/version, risk\_code, severity, created\_at)  
* Status changes (from\_status, to\_status, changed\_at, changed\_by\_role, changed\_by\_token if permitted)  
* Closure category selected (controlled vocabulary)  
* Minimal closure notes (non-GMP, short)

**What Must Not Be Stored**  
The Sentinel must not store:

* GMP values (weights, temps, volumes, etc.)  
* Specifications or acceptance limits  
* Free-text batch narratives  
* Raw operator identifiers or raw batch numbers  
* Attachments, screenshots, or signatures

**Rationale**

A minimal lifecycle supports real-time awareness and auditability without transforming the Sentinel into a system of record or a deviation management system.
