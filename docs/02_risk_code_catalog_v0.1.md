## DOC 02 \- Deviation Risk Code Catalog

## **Overview**

Deviation Risk Codes represent standardized categories of potential deviation risk identified during Digital Batch Record execution. These codes are used to classify advisory alerts generated by the GxP Deviation Risk Sentinel.

Risk codes are stable identifiers and **do not** represent confirmed deviations. Severity values represent default risk levels and may be overridden by rule logic based on contextual factors.

**Allowed Data (Metadata Only)**

The following categories of data are **permitted** for ingestion and processing:

| *Risk Code*  | *Description*  | *Default Severity* |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| DR-001 | Missing required entry at submit attempt | Critical |
| DR-002 | Step open exceeds allowed time window | High |
| DR-003 | Out-of-sequence step attempt | High |
| DR-004 | Calculation fail flag from DBR | Critical |
| DR-005 | Required verification missing | Critical |
| DR-006 | Hold/exception state triggered | High |
| DR-007 | Session timeout during critical step | Medium |
| DR-008 | Excessive edits/reversals indicator | Medium |
| DR-009 | Late entry detected (back-dated signature indicator) | Critical |
| DR-010 | Required attachment/reference missing | Medium |

**Usage Notes**

* Risk codes identify potential deviation risk, not confirmed deviations    
* Alerts generated using these codes require human review    
* Multiple risk alerts may occur within a single batch execution    
* Risk codes are versioned and maintained as a controlled vocabulary
