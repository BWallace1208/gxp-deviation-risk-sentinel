## DOC 00 \- System Boundary & Intended Use

## **Purpose of This Document**

This document defines the intended purpose, scope, and boundaries of the GxP Deviation Risk Sentinel. It establishes what the system is designed to do, what it is explicitly not designed to do, and where its responsibility ends relative to validated GMP systems.

The Deviation Risk Sentinel is an advisory, read-only monitoring system that evaluates workflow metadata emitted during Digital Batch Record (DBR) execution to identify potential deviation risk conditions in near real time. The system operates exclusively on non-GMP metadata and produces standardized risk alerts to support Quality and operational awareness.

This system does not function as a system of record, does not store or process GMP process values, and does not modify, replace, or interfere with validated execution systems such as DBR, MES, LIMS, IMEX, or eQMS platforms. All source systems remain authoritative for batch data, audit trails, deviation initiation, and product disposition decisions.

The Deviation Risk Sentinel does not initiate deviations, place batch holds, or make quality determinations. All alerts generated by the system require human review and decision-making in accordance with established quality processes.

This document exists to clearly articulate system boundaries, prevent scope creep, and ensure that the design and implementation remain aligned with regulated-system best practices while avoiding unintended GMP impact.

**1\. System Name**  
*GxP Deviation Risk Sentinel* (Metadata-Only)

**2\. Intended Use**  
This system is an advisory monitoring service designed to detect potential deviation risks during Digital Batch Record (DBR) execution using workflow metadata only. It operates in read-only mode and does not modify batch records, initiate deviations, or make batch disposition decisions.

**3\. Out of Scope** 

* No capture or storage of GMP process values.  
* No modification of DBR, MES, LIMS, or IMEX systems.  
* No automatic deviation creation or batch holds.  
* No product quality decisions

**4\. System Boundary**

* Consumes events, not records.  
* Produces alerts, not quality records.  
* Relies on source systems as the system of record.

**5\. Regulatory Positioning**  
This system is presented as a vendor-neutral, portfolio implementation intended to demonstrate regulated system design principles. In a production environment, it would be classified as a non-product impacting, advisory monitoring system and brought under site specific validation and document control. Formal SOP numbering, effective dates, and approvals are intentionally omitted from this implementation.
